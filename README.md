# Activerecord::Firewall

This gem adds a patch to ActiveRecord that attempts to stop IDOR 
problems in multi-tenant applications by adding a new AR attribute
type generated by the method `firewalled_belongs_to`. 

## Usage

This plugin adds a method `firewalled_belongs_to` to all ActiveRecord 
models with the same usage as `belongs_to`. `firewalled_belongs_to` expects
that if you call `firewalled_belongs_to :shop` in the `Product` model, you will define `Current.shop`. This will add a check each time a `Product` 
object is loaded from the database to ensure that the associated `Shop` object
has the ID of the current shop.
